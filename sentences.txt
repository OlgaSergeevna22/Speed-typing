Extremes meet
East or West home is best
Better late than never
All's well that ends well
Out of sight out of mind
As fit as a fiddle
No sweet without sweat
A penny saved is a penny gained
By one ’ s father ’ s side
Just a joke
Have a heart
A good beginning makes a good ending
Too good to be true
Who knew , who is who
New lords new laws
